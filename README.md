# Introduction
Hit Plane is a python project. In this project, user can control plane by using keyboard keys. User’s plane will eject bullet automatically to hit enemies’ plane. The more planes users hit, the higher scores they get. When user’s plane collides with enemies’ plane three times, this game is over.

## Why Hit Plane
The purpose of making this game is to recall memory of my childhood and build a way to relax after study. The first computer game I played was “Thunder fighter”, which is the same type of game with the project I will do. However, this project is just a 2D mini game with simple game screen.

## Requirements
* python 2/3
* pygame

## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository and then import source code under /src into your Pycharm or directly run it in your favorited python environment.
